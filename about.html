    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I am excited to have been raised up in a humble background and to have associated myself with the people from communities and from different backgrounds.
    I would like to impact the comming generation in a positive way Technologically and to make them solve the proplems they face in real life. I like seeing people sorrounding me succeed
    and achieve their needs in their lives. I was raised so that i help people realize their dreams and help the needy in the society to know that their is another life waiting for them ahead if only they work
    hard towards that life<p>
        My first day to come to Nairobi from a small village in Bomet was a great achievement that everybody in my village could wish to have a privilege like mine. All the challenges i faced in the village was 
        enough to teach me who i am. They thought me to be patient and work hard to become someone better that who i am. Now in Nairobi i got a job at <strong><a href="https://www.digitaldividedata.com/">Digital Divide Data (DDD)</a></strong> 
        as a Data clerk. I was so happy that the lord has really answered my prayers since i had been praying day in day out for a miracle to happen. At DDD together with employeers we were promised a scholarship 
        as long as we work smart. I worked extra-hard but due to some unavoidable circumstances we didn't get scholarship as it was promised but i never gave up until when i heard of  <strong><a href="https://moringaschool.com/programs/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=april-2020-prep_classes&gclid=CjwKCAjw4pT1BRBUEiwAm5QuR39ihz534dSGr4_w8tpCD2mlLPS1LQIrsGhWmZ-3ylFTi_vxaNsCthoCvoQQAvD_BwE">Moringa School</a></strong>
        that is when i knew that my prayers have been answered again after i qualified for the scholarship.<p>

    <h2>Why i decided to take a class on programming</h2>
    <p>There’s no denying that technology now dominates a huge amount of different industries. Being computer illiterate just won’t cut it any more in the world of work.
     And ‘learning to code’ seems to be the buzzword at the moment. And everyone from Bill Gates to Obama is encouraging young people to give it a go.</p>
